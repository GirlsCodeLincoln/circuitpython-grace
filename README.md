# Grace
A library for easily coding advanced [NeoPixel](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168) light patterns with [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io). Grace takes its name from not only allowing beginners to "gracefully" code complex light sequences, but also from Grace Hopper, a pioneer of computer technology.
